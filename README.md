# Restaurant Review API Project

From: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/create-rest-apis-with-spring-and-java/tracks/spring-apis-portfolio-project/modules/spring-dining-review-api/kanban_projects/dining-review-api

For this project, you will build an application using everything you’ve learned so far. You’ll start from scratch and finish with a working API of your own. This is your chance to showcase your skills to potential employers and teammates!

We’ve provided the high-level tasks to complete this project, which includes a few new techniques you may have to research on your own. If you’d like to challenge yourself even further, keep building! This project can be extended in a variety of ways as you learn more Spring concepts.

Project Objectives:
- Construct a RESTful web API with data persistence using Spring and Spring Data JPA
- Use Spring Initializr to generate the initial Java project
- Configure application properties for certain dependencies, including the H2 embedded database
- Define the entities that comprise this application scenario
- Define the repositories that enable creating, updating, and querying these different entities
- Define the API contracts that will enable this application scenario
- Leverage the convenience of Lombok
- Use cURL to test your API scenarios

Addional Challenge(set personally)
- Use Contract First approach
- Design yaml using Swagger Editor
- Create a Maven multi module project
