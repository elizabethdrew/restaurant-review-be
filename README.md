# Application Documentation

## 1. Introduction
*Briefly describe the purpose of the application and its main features. Mention any external dependencies or frameworks used.*

## 2. Prerequisites
*List the required software and tools to build, run, and test the application. Include version numbers, if necessary.*

## 3. Setup and Installation
*Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment. Describe how to install dependencies, configure the application, and run it locally.*

## 4. Application Architecture
*Give an overview of the main components and layers of the application. Include a simple diagram illustrating the architecture.*

## 5. Code Structure

*Briefly describe each package and its purpose. Explain the main classes and interfaces within each package. Provide guidance on naming conventions, directory structures, and other best practices followed in the codebase.*

**Naming Conventions:** Class names should be in `PascalCase`, describing their purpose. Method names should be in `camelCase` and start with a verb.

### Package: `dev.drew.restaurantreview.config`

**Purpose:** This package contains configuration classes for the application. In this case, it includes the `SecurityConfig` class, which configures the Spring Security settings for the application.

**Directory Structure:** Configuration classes should be placed in a `config` package within the application.

**Class: `SecurityConfig`**

- **Description:** This class configures the security settings for the application, such as authentication and authorization rules. It sets up basic authentication, allowing certain HTTP requests to be accessible without authentication and requiring authentication for the rest.

### Package: `dev.drew.restaurantreview.controller`

**Purpose:** The controller package is responsible for handling incoming requests from clients and returning responses.

**Directory Structure:** The directory structure for controllers should follow the package structure of the application and be placed in a directory named `controller`.

**Class: `RestaurantController`**

- **Description:** This class is responsible for handling requests related to restaurants. The `RestaurantController` class is a Spring RestController that implements the `RestaurantsApi` interface. It contains methods that map to different endpoints for handling HTTP requests related to restaurants. The class is annotated with `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` which marks it as a controller and maps all endpoints within the class to the root URL of the application. Additionally, the `@PreAuthorize` annotation is used to restrict access to some endpoints based on user authentication status.

### **Package: `dev.drew.restaurantreview.service`**
**Purpose:** This package contains the service layer classes responsible for the business logic of the application, such as interacting with repositories, mapping between model objects, and handling exceptions.

**Directory Structure:** Service classes should be placed in a **`service`** package within the application.

**Class: `RestaurantServiceImpl`**

- **Description:** This class implements the **`RestaurantService`** interface and is responsible for handling business logic related to restaurants. It interacts with the **`RestaurantRepository`** and **`ReviewRepository`**, as well as the **`RestaurantMapper`**. The class is annotated with **`@Service`**, which marks it as a Spring service bean.
